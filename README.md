 # 👋 Hi , I'm Siddhant Sahu
 

<p>  
I'm a beginner software developer. I'm excited to be learning about programming and am eager to improve my skills.
 

-👨‍💻Currently, I'm focusing on learning- "python, and "vim". 
   
-🤔I'm interested in exploring different areas of programming and hope to learn more about "software development," and much more.

-👨‍💻👩‍💻  I'm excited to be part of the developer community and hope to collaborate with others and contribute to open-source projects in the future.

-🎨 When I'm not coding, I enjoy ["listening to music," "I love to explore different different things."]. 

  
- 👨‍💻 All of my projects are available at [https://github.com/siddhant660](https://github.com/siddhant660)
